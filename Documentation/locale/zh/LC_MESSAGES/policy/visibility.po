"While :ref:`monitor` provides introspection into datapath state, by "
"default it will only provide visibility into L3/L4 packet events. If "
":ref:`l7_policy` are configured, one can get visibility into L7 "
"protocols, but this requires the full policy for each selected endpoint "
"to be written. To get more visibility into the application without "
"configuring a full policy, Cilium provides a means of prescribing "
"visibility via `annotations <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview"
"/working-with-objects/annotations/>`_ when running in tandem with "
"Kubernetes."
