"To determine which policy rules are currently in effect for an endpoint "
"the data from ``cilium endpoint list`` and ``cilium endpoint get`` can be"
" paired with the data from ``cilium policy get``. ``cilium endpoint get``"
" will list the labels of each rule that applies to an endpoint. The list "
"of labels can be passed to ``cilium policy get`` to show that exact "
"source policy.  Note that rules that have no labels cannot be fetched "
"alone (a no label ``cilium policy get`` returns the complete policy on "
"the node). Rules with the same labels will be returned together."
