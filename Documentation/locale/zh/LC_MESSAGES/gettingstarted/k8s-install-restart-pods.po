"If you did not create a cluster with the nodes tainted with the taint "
"``node.cilium.io/agent-not-ready``, then unmanaged pods need to be "
"restarted manually. Restart all already running pods which are not "
"running in host-networking mode to ensure that Cilium starts managing "
"them. This is required to ensure that all pods which have been running "
"before Cilium was deployed have network connectivity provided by Cilium "
"and NetworkPolicy applies to them:"

"This may error out on macOS due to ``-r`` being unsupported by ``xargs``."
" In this case you can safely run this command without ``-r`` with the "
"symptom that this will hang if there are no pods to restart. You can stop"
" this with ``ctrl-c``."
