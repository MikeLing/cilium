"This document explains how to configure Cilium's native support for "
"announcing ``LoadBalancer`` IPs of ``Services`` and a Kubernetes node's "
"Pod CIDR range via BGP. It leverages `MetalLB's "
"<https://metallb.universe.tf/>`_ simple and effective implementation of "
"IP allocation and the minimal BGP protocol support to do this. The "
"configuration for Cilium is the same as MetalLB's configuration."

"Specifically, if a ``Service`` of type ``LoadBalancer`` is created, "
"Cilium will allocate an IP for it from a specified pool. Once the IP is "
"allocated, the Agents will announce via BGP depending on the "
"``Service``'s ``ExternalTrafficPolicy``. See MetalLB's `documentation "
"<https://metallb.universe.tf/usage/#bgp>`_ on this specific topic."
