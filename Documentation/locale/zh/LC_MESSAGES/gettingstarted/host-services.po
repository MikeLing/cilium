"Host-reachable services for TCP and UDP requires a v4.19.57, v5.1.16, "
"v5.2.0 or more recent Linux kernel. Note that v5.0.y kernels do not have "
"the fix required to run host-reachable services with UDP since at this "
"point in time the v5.0.y stable kernel is end-of-life (EOL) and not "
"maintained anymore. For only enabling TCP-based host-reachable services a"
" v4.17.0 or newer kernel is required. The most optimal kernel with the "
"full feature set is v5.8."

"Host-reachable services act transparent to Cilium's lower layer datapath "
"in that upon connect system call (TCP, connected UDP) or sendmsg as well "
"as recvmsg (UDP) the destination IP is checked for an existing service IP"
" and one of the service backends is selected as a target, meaning, while "
"the application is assuming its connection to the service address, the "
"corresponding kernel's socket is actually connected to the backend "
"address and therefore no additional lower layer NAT is required."

"The kernel eBPF cgroup hooks operate at connect(2), sendmsg(2) and "
"recvmsg(2) system call layers for connecting the application to one of "
"the service backends. In the v5.8 Linux kernel, a getpeername(2) hook for"
" eBPF has been added in order to also reverse translate the connected "
"sock addresses for application's getpeername(2) calls in Cilium. For "
"kernels older than v5.8 such reverse translation is not taking place for "
"this system call. For the vast majority of applications not having this "
"translation at getpeername(2) does not cause any issues. There is one "
"known case for libceph where its monitor might return an error since "
"expected peer address mismatches."
