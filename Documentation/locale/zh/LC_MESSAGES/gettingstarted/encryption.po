"To determine if a packet needs to be encrypted or not, transparent "
"encryption relies on the same mechanisms as policy enforcement to decide "
"if the destination of an outgoing packet belongs to a Cilium-managed "
"endpoint on a remote node. This means that if an endpoint is allowed to "
"initiate traffic to targets outside of the cluster, it is possible for "
"that endpoint to send packets to arbitrary IP addresses before Cilium "
"learns that a particular IP address belongs to a remote Cilium-managed "
"endpoint or newly joined remote Cilium host in the cluster. In such a "
"case there is a time window during which Cilium will send out the initial"
" packets unencrypted, as it has to assume the destination IP address is "
"outside of the cluster. Once the information about the newly created "
"endpoint has propagated in the cluster and Cilium knows that the IP "
"address is an endpoint on a remote node, it will start encrypting packets"
" using the encryption key of the remote node."

"The workaround for this issue is to ensure that the endpoint is not "
"allowed to send unencrypted traffic to arbitrary targets outside of the "
"cluster. This can be achieved by defining an egress policy which either "
"completely disallows traffic to ``reserved:world`` identities, or only "
"allows egress traffic to addresses outside of the cluster to a certain "
"subset of trusted IP addresses using ``toCIDR``, ``toCIDRSet`` and "
"``toFQDN`` rules. See :ref:`policy_examples` for more details about how "
"to write network policies that restrict egress traffic to certain "
"endpoints."
