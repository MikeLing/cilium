"When WireGuard is enabled in Cilium, the agent running on each cluster "
"node will establish a secure WireGuard tunnel between it and all other "
"known nodes in the cluster. Each node automatically creates its own "
"encryption key-pair and distributes its public key via the "
"``io.cilium.network.wg-pub-key`` annotation in the Kubernetes "
"``CiliumNode`` custom resource object. Each node's public key is then "
"used by other nodes to decrypt and encrypt traffic from and to Cilium-"
"managed endpoints running on that node."

"Packets are not encrypted when they are destined to the same node from "
"which they were sent. This behavior is intended. Encryption would provide"
" no benefits in that case, given that the raw traffic can be observed on "
"the node anyway."

"The WireGuard tunnel endpoint is exposed on UDP port ``51871`` on each "
"node. If you run Cilium in an environment that requires firewall rules to"
" enable connectivity, you will have to ensure that all Cilium cluster "
"nodes can reach each other via that port."

"When running in the tunneling mode (i.e. with VXLAN or Geneve), pod to "
"pod traffic will be sent only over the WireGuard tunnel which means that "
"the packets will bypass the other tunnel, and thus they will be "
"encapsulated only once."

"Before you enable WireGuard in Cilium, please ensure that the Linux "
"distribution running on your cluster nodes has support for WireGuard in "
"kernel mode (i.e. ``CONFIG_WIREGUARD=m`` on Linux 5.6 and newer, or via "

"If your kernel or distribution does not support WireGuard, Cilium agent "
"can be configured to fall back on the user-space implementation via the "
"``--enable-wireguard-userspace-fallback`` flag. When this flag is enabled"
" and Cilium detects that the kernel has no native support for WireGuard, "
"it will fallback on the ``wireguard-go`` user-space implementation of "
"WireGuard. When running the user-space implementation, encryption and "
"decryption of packets is performed by the ``cilium-agent`` process. As a "
"consequence, connectivity between Cilium-managed endpoints will be "
"unavailable whenever the ``cilium-agent`` process is restarted, such as "
"during upgrades or configuration changes. Running WireGuard in user-space"
" mode is therefore not recommended for production workloads that require "
"high availability."
