"This guide explains how to set up Cilium in combination with the AWS VPC "
"CNI plugin. In this hybrid mode, the AWS VPC CNI plugin is responsible "
"for setting up the virtual network devices as well as for IP address "
"management (IPAM) via ENIs. After the initial networking is setup for a "
"given pod, the Cilium CNI plugin is called to attach eBPF programs to the"
" network devices set up by the AWS VPC CNI plugin in order to enforce "
"network policies, perform load-balancing and provide encryption."
