"`Memcached <https://memcached.org/>`_ is a high performance, distributed "
"memory object caching system. It's simple yet powerful, and used by "
"dynamic web applications to alleviate database load. Memcached is "
"designed to work efficiently for a very large number of open connections."
" Thus, clients are encouraged to cache their connections rather than the "
"overhead of reopening TCP connections every time they need to store or "
"retrieve data. Multiple clients can benefit from this distributed cache's"
" performance benefits."
