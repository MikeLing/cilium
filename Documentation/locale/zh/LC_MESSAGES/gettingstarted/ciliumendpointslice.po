"When enabled, Cilium operator watches CEP objects and group/batch slim "
"versions of them into CES objects. Cilium agent watches CES objects to "
"learn about remote endpoints in this mode. API-server stress due to "
"remote endpoint info propagation should be reduced in this case, allowing"
" for better scalability, at the cost of potentially longer delay before "
"identity of new endpoint is recognized throughout the cluster."

"Root cause for this potential disruption is that when identity of CEPs "
"change, the operator will try to re-group/re-batch them into a different "
"set of CESs. This breaks the atomic operation of an UPGRADE into that of "
"an DELETE and an ADD. If the agent gets the DELETE (from old CES) first, "
"it will remove the corresponding CEP's information from the ipcache, "
"resulting in traffic to/from said CEP with an UNKNOWN identity."
