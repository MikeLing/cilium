"A Cilium committer is a participant in the project with the ability to "
"commit code directly to the master repository. Commit access grants a "
"broad ability to affect the progress of the project as presented by its "
"most important artifact, the code and related resources that produce "
"working binaries of Cilium. As such it represents a significant level of "
"trust in an individual's commitment to working with other committers and "
"the community at large for the benefit of the project. It can not be "
"granted lightly and, in the worst case, must be revocable if the trust "
"placed in an individual was inappropriate."
