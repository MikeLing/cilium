"We recommend that operators with larger environments limit the set of "
"identity-relevant labels to avoid frequent creation of new security "
"identities. Many Kubernetes labels are not useful for policy enforcement "
"or visibility. A few good examples of such labels include timestamps or "
"hashes. These labels, when included in evaluation, cause Cilium to "
"generate a unique identity for each pod instead of a single identity for "
"all of the pods that comprise a service or application."
