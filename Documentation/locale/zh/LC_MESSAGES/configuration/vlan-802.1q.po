"Cilium enables firewalling on native devices in use and will filter all "
"unknown traffic. VLAN 802.1q packets will always be passed through their "
"main device with associated tag (e.g. VLAN device is ``eth0.4000`` and "
"its main interface is ``eth0``). By default, Cilium will allow all tags "
"from the native devices (i.e. if ``eth0.4000`` is controlled by Cilium "
"and has an eBPF program attached, then VLAN tag ``4000`` will be allowed "
"on device ``eth0``). Additional VLAN tags may be allowed with the cilium-"
"agent flag ``--vlan-bpf-bypass=4001,4002`` (or Helm variable ``--set bpf"
".vlan-bpf-bypass=4001,4002``)."

"The list of allowed VLAN tags cannot be too big in order to keep eBPF "
"program of predictable size. Currently this list should contain no more "
"than 5 entries. If you need more, then there is only one way for now: you"
" need to allow all tags with cilium-agent flag ``--vlan-bpf-bypass=0``."
