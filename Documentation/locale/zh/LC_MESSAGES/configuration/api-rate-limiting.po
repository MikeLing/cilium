"The per node Cilium agent is essentially event-driven. For example, the "
"CNI plugin is invoked when a new workload is scheduled onto the node "
"which in turn makes an API call to the Cilium agent to allocate an IP "
"address and create the Cilium endpoint. Another example is loading of "
"network policy or service definitions where changes of these definitions "
"will create an event which will notify the Cilium agent that a "
"modification is required."

"Due to being event-driven, the amount of work performed by the Cilium "
"agent highly depends on the rate of external events it receives. In order"
" to constrain the resources that the Cilium agent consumes, it can be "
"helpful to restrict the rate and allowed parallel executions of API "
"calls."
