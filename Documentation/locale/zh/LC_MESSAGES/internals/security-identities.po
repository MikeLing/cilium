"For ClusterMesh (2), 8 bits are used as the ``cluster-id`` which "
"identifies the cluster in the ClusterMesh, into the 3rd octet as shown by"

"CIDR identities (3) are local to each node. CIDR identities begin from "
"``1`` and end at ``16777215``, however since they're shifted by ``24``, "
"this makes their effective range ``1 | (1 << 24)`` to ``16777215 | (1 << "
"24)`` or from ``16777217`` to ``33554431``. When CIDR policies are "
"applied, the identity generated is local to each node. In other words, "
"the identity may not be the same for the same CIDR policy across two "
"nodes."

"CIDR identities are never used for traffic between Cilium-managed nodes, "
"so they do not need to fit inside of a VXLAN or Geneve virtual network "
"field. Non-CIDR identities are limited to 24 bits so that they will fit "
"in these fields on the wire, but since CIDR identities will not be "
"encoded in these packets, they can start with a higher value. Hence, the "
"minimum value for a CIDR identity is ``2^24 + 1``."
