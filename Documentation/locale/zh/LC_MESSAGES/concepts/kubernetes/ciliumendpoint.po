"When managing pods in Kubernetes, Cilium will create a Custom Resource "
"Definition (CRD) of Kind ``CiliumEndpoint``. One ``CiliumEndpoint`` is "
"created for each pod managed by Cilium, with the same name and in the "
"same namespace. The ``CiliumEndpoint`` objects contain the same "
"information as the json output of ``cilium endpoint get`` under the "
"``.status`` field, but can be fetched for all pods in the cluster.  "
"Adding the ``-o json`` will export more information about each endpoint. "
"This includes the endpoint's labels, security identity and the policy in "
"effect on it."
