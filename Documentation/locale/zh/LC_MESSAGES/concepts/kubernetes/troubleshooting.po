"In this example, we see a desired state of 1 with 0 being ready. This "

"If you are running Kubernetes Apiserver outside of your cluster for some "
"reason (like keeping master nodes behind a firewall), make sure that you "

"toleration/>`_ for Cilium DaemonSet to ensure that Cilium pods will be "
