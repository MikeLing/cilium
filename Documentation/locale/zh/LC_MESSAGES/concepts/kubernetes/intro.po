"In Kubernetes, containers are deployed within units referred to as "

"Kubernetes has developed the Services abstraction which provides the user"

"running that particular service."

"Without Cilium, kube-proxy is installed on every node, watches for "
"endpoints and services addition and removal on the kube-master which "
"allows it to apply the necessary enforcement on iptables. Thus, the "
"received and sent traffic from and to the pods are properly routed to the"
" node and port serving for that service. For more information you can "
"check out the kubernetes user guide for `Services "

"When implementing ClusterIP, Cilium acts on the same principles as kube-"
"proxy, it watches for services addition or removal, but instead of doing "
