"When managing pods in Kubernetes, Cilium will create a Custom Resource "
"Definition (CRD) of Kind :ref:`CiliumEndpoint<CiliumEndpoint>` (CEP) for "
"each pod managed by Cilium. If ``enable-cilium-endpoint-slice`` is "
"enabled, then Cilium will also create a CRD of Kind "
"``CiliumEndpointSlice`` (CES) that groups a set of slim CEP objects with "
"the same :ref:`security identity<arch_id_security>` together into a "
"single CES object and broadcast CES objects to communicate identities to "
"other agents instead of doing so via broadcasting CEP. In most cases, "
"this reduces load on the control plane and can sustain larger-scaled "
"cluster using the same master resource."
