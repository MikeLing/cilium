"Observability is provided by Hubble which enables deep visibility into "
"the communication and behavior of services as well as the networking "
"infrastructure in a completely transparent manner. Hubble is able to "
"provide visibility at the node level, cluster level or even across "
"clusters in a :ref:`Cluster Mesh` scenario. For an introduction to Hubble"
" and how it relates to Cilium, read the section :ref:`intro`."

"By default, the Hubble API is scoped to each individual node on which the"
" Cilium agent runs. In other words, networking visibility is only "
"provided for traffic observed by the local Cilium agent. In this "
"scenario, the only way to interact with the Hubble API is by using the "
"Hubble CLI (``hubble``) to query the Hubble API provided via a local Unix"
" Domain Socket.  The Hubble CLI binary is installed by default on Cilium "
"agent pods."

"When Hubble Relay is deployed, Hubble provides full network visibility. "
"In this scenario, the Hubble Relay service provides a Hubble API which "
"scopes the entire cluster or even multiple clusters in a ClusterMesh "
"scenario. Hubble data can be accessed by pointing a Hubble CLI "
"(``hubble``) to the Hubble Relay service or via Hubble UI. Hubble UI is a"
" web interface which enables automatic discovery of the services "
"dependency graph at the L3/L4 and even L7 layer, allowing user-friendly "
"visualization and filtering of data flows as a service map."
