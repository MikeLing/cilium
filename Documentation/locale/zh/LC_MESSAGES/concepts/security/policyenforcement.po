"All security policies are described assuming stateful policy enforcement "
"for session based protocols. This means that the intent of the policy is "
"to describe allowed direction of connection establishment. If the policy "
"allows ``A => B`` then reply packets from ``B`` to ``A`` are "
"automatically allowed as well.  However, ``B`` is not automatically "
"allowed to initiate connections to ``A``. If that outcome is desired, "
"then both directions must be explicitly allowed."

"Security policies may be enforced at *ingress* or *egress*. For "
"*ingress*, this means that each cluster node verifies all incoming "
"packets and determines whether the packet is allowed to be transmitted to"
" the intended endpoint. Correspondingly, for *egress* each cluster node "
"verifies outgoing packets and determines whether the packet is allowed to"
" be transmitted to its intended destination."

"In order to enforce identity based security in a multi host cluster, the "
"identity of the transmitting endpoint is embedded into every network "
"packet that is transmitted in between cluster nodes. The receiving "
"cluster node can then extract the identity and verify whether a "
"particular identity is allowed to communicate with any of the local "
"endpoints."

"If no policy is loaded, the default behavior is to allow all "
"communication unless policy enforcement has been explicitly enabled. As "
"soon as the first policy rule is loaded, policy enforcement is enabled "
"automatically and any communication must then be white listed or the "
"relevant packets will be dropped."

"Similarly, if an endpoint is not subject to an *L4* policy, communication"
" from and to all ports is permitted. Associating at least one *L4* policy"
" to an endpoint will block all connectivity to ports unless explicitly "
"allowed."
