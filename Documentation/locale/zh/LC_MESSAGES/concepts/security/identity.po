"Container management systems such as Kubernetes deploy a networking model"
" which assigns an individual IP address to each pod (group of "
"containers). This ensures simplicity in architecture, avoids unnecessary "
"network address translation (NAT) and provides each individual container "
"with a full range of port numbers to use. The logical consequence of this"
" model is that depending on the size of the cluster and total number of "
"pods, the networking layer has to manage a large number of IP addresses."

"Traditionally security enforcement architectures have been based on IP "
"address filters.  Let's walk through a simple example: If all pods with "
"the label ``role=frontend`` should be allowed to initiate connections to "
"all pods with the label ``role=backend`` then each cluster node which "
"runs at least one pod with the label ``role=backend`` must have a "
"corresponding filter installed which allows all IP addresses of all "
"``role=frontend`` pods to initiate a connection to the IP addresses of "
"all local ``role=backend`` pods. All other connection requests should be "
"denied. This could look like this: If the destination address is "
"*10.1.1.2* then allow the connection only if the source address is one of"
" the following *[10.1.2.2,10.1.2.3,20.4.9.1]*."

"Every time a new pod with the label ``role=frontend`` or ``role=backend``"
" is either started or stopped, the rules on every cluster node which run "
"any such pods must be updated by either adding or removing the "
"corresponding IP address from the list of allowed IP addresses. In large "
"distributed applications, this could imply updating thousands of cluster "
"nodes multiple times per second depending on the churn rate of deployed "
"pods. Worse, the starting of new ``role=frontend`` pods must be delayed "
"until all servers running ``role=backend`` pods have been updated with "
"the new security rules as otherwise connection attempts from the new pod "
"could be mistakenly dropped. This makes it difficult to scale "
"efficiently."

"In order to avoid these complications which can limit scalability and "
"flexibility, Cilium entirely separates security from network addressing. "
"Instead, security is based on the identity of a pod, which is derived "
"through labels.  This identity can be shared between pods. This means "
"that when the first ``role=frontend`` pod is started, Cilium assigns an "
"identity to that pod which is then allowed to initiate connections to the"
" identity of the ``role=backend`` pod. The subsequent start of additional"
" ``role=frontend`` pods only requires to resolve this identity via a key-"
"value store, no action has to be performed on any of the cluster nodes "
"hosting ``role=backend`` pods. The starting of a new pod must only be "
"delayed until the identity of the pod has been resolved which is a much "
"simpler operation than updating the security rules on all other cluster "
"nodes."
