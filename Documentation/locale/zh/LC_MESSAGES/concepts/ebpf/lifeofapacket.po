"First we show the local endpoint to endpoint flow with optional L7 Policy"
" on egress and ingress. Followed by the same endpoint to endpoint flow "
"with socket layer enforcement enabled. With socket layer enforcement "
"enabled for TCP traffic the handshake initiating the connection will "
"traverse the endpoint policy object until TCP state is ESTABLISHED. Then "
"after the connection is ESTABLISHED only the L7 Policy object is still "
"required."

"Next we show local endpoint to egress with optional overlay network. In "
"the optional overlay network traffic is forwarded out the Linux network "
"interface corresponding to the overlay. In the default case the overlay "
"interface is named cilium_vxlan. Similar to above, when socket layer "
"enforcement is enabled and a L7 proxy is in use we can avoid running the "
"endpoint policy block between the endpoint and the L7 Policy for TCP "
"traffic. An optional L3 encryption block will encrypt the packet if "
"enabled."

"Finally we show ingress to local endpoint also with optional overlay "

"handled through the normal flow."
