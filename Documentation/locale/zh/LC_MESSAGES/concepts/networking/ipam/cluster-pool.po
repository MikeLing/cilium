"The cluster-scope IPAM mode assigns per-node PodCIDRs to each node and "
"allocates IPs using a host-scope allocator on each node. It is thus "
"similar to the :ref:`k8s_hostscope` mode. The difference is that instead "
"of Kubernetes assigning the per-node PodCIDRs via the Kubernetes "
"``v1.Node`` resource, the Cilium operator will manage the per-node "
"PodCIDRs via the ``v2.CiliumNode`` resource. The advantage of this mode "
"is that it does not depend on Kubernetes being configured to hand out "
"per-node PodCIDRs."
