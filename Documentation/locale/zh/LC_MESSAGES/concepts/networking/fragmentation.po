"By default, Cilium configures the eBPF datapath to perform IP fragment "
"tracking to allow protocols that do not support segmentation (such as "
"UDP) to transparently transmit large messages over the network. IP "
"fragment tracking is implemented in eBPF using an LRU (*Least Recently "
"Used*) map which requires Linux 4.10 or later. This feature may be "
"configured using the following options:"

"When running Cilium with kube-proxy, fragmented NodePort traffic may "
"break due to a kernel bug where route MTU is not respected for forwarded "
"packets. Cilium fragments tracking requires the first logical fragment to"
" arrive first. Due to the kernel bug, additional fragmentation on the "
"outer encapsulation layer may happen that causes packet reordering and "
"results in a failure in tracking the fragments."
