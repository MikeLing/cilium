"eBPF is a Linux kernel bytecode interpreter originally introduced to "
"filter network packets, e.g. tcpdump and socket filters. It has since "
"been extended with additional data structures such as hashtable and "
"arrays as well as additional actions to support packet mangling, "
"forwarding, encapsulation, etc. An in-kernel verifier ensures that eBPF "
"programs are safe to run and a JIT compiler converts the bytecode to CPU "
"architecture specific instructions for native execution efficiency. eBPF "
"programs can be run at various hooking points in the kernel such as for "
"incoming and outgoing packets."
