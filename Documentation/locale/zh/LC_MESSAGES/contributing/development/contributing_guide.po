"If reviewers have requested changes and those changes have been "
"addressed, re-request a review for the reviewers that have requested "
"changes. Otherwise, those reviewers will not be notified and your PR will"
" not receive any reviews. If the PR is considerably large (e.g. with more"
" than 200 lines changed and/or more than 6 commits) create new commit for"
" each review. This will make the review process smoother as GitHub has "
"limitations that prevents reviewers from only seeing the new changes "
"added since the last time they have reviewed a PR. Once all reviews are "
"addressed those commits should be squashed against the commit that "
"introduced those changes. This can be easily accomplished by the usage of"
" ``git rebase -i origin/master`` and in that windows, move these new "
"commits below the commit that introduced the changes and replace the work"
" ``pick`` with ``fixup``. In the following example, commit ``d2cb02265`` "
"will be meld into ``9c62e62d8`` and commit ``146829b59`` will be meld "
"into ``9400fed20``."
