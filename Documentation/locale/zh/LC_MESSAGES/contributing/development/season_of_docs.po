"Cilium (current version 1.11, first released in 2017) is an Apache "
"2.0-licensed project for providing, securing, and observing network "

" the revolutionary Linux Kernel technology eBPF. Our users adopt Cilium "
"to solve their cloud networking, observability, and security issues at "

"countries around the world. Multiple companies have staff paid to work on"
" Cilium too. Cilium is an incubating project in the Cloud Native "

"Cloud native networking and security are complex topics that even long "
"time practitioners struggle to master. Cilium documentation has grown "
"organically over time and the project has mainly been used by advanced "
"cloud native users. The documentation lacks the structure that new, and "
"even existing, users can rely on to quickly find the information they "
"need. In addition, users sometimes struggle to discover all of the "
"features and functionality of Cilium because the documentation does not "
"make them easily discoverable. Finally, new users often have questions "
"about how to troubleshoot setting up their network."
