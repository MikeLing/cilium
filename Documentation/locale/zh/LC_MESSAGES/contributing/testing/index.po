"There are multiple ways to test Cilium functionality, including unit-"
"testing and integration testing. In order to improve developer "
"throughput, we provide ways to run both the unit and integration tests in"
" your own workspace as opposed to being fully reliant on the Cilium CI "
"infrastructure. We encourage all PRs to add unit tests and if necessary, "
"integration tests. Consult the following pages to see how to run the "
"variety of tests that have been written for Cilium, and information about"
" Cilium's CI infrastructure."
